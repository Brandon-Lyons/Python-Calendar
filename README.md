#Python Calendar

This is my attempt at recreating my Ruby Calendar in Python. Like the Ruby version, this project will use TDD. The goal is to create an output as close to the cal output as possible.

##Features
1. Takes command line arguments and outputs the appropiate calendar
2. If month and year are input output will be month of that year only
3. If year is input output will be the entire year 4 rows 3 months per row
4. If there is no integer input after cal the ouput will be the current month of the current year only

##Usage

For a specific month of a specific year<br>
`python cal.py 1 2012`<br>
For the entire year<br>
`python cal.py 2012`<br>
For the current month of the current year<br>
`python cal.py`<br>
